# DeorphaNN
DeorphaNN is a graph neural network that predicts peptide agonists for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) by integrating active-state GPCR-peptide predicted structures, interatomic interactions, and deep learning protein representations.

## Data Preprocessing
For each GPCR-peptide query:
1) Use [AlphaFold-multistate](https://github.com/huhlim/alphafold-multistate) to acquire the predicted active state of the GPCR. Trim the top ranked active state structure according to pLDDT and DeepTMHMM identity (template_trim.py).
2) Run AlphaFold-Multimer on your GPCR-peptide complex, using the trimmed active state GPCR as a template. The pdbs must be relaxed--to relax post hoc, use pdb_relax.py. Process the pair representations using process_pair_reps.py to obtain three sets of embeddings, averaged across all models. 
3) Run Arpeggio on the relaxed GPCR-peptide pdb (top ranked by peptide pLDDT) using arpeggio.py
