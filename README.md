# DeorphaNN
DeorphaNN is a graph neural network that predicts peptide agonists for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) by integrating active-state GPCR-peptide predicted structures, interatomic interactions, and deep learning protein representations.

## Data Preprocessing
For each GPCR-peptide query:
1) Use [AlphaFold-multistate](https://github.com/huhlim/alphafold-multistate) to acquire the predicted active state of the GPCR. Trim the top ranked active state structure according to pLDDT and DeepTMHMM identity ([template_trim.ipynb](https://githubtocolab.com/Zebreu/DeorphaNN/blob/main/template_trim.ipynb)).
2) Run AlphaFold-Multimer on your GPCR-peptide complex using the trimmed active state GPCR as a template. Make sure to save the pair representation, and relax the predicted structures. 
3) Process the pair representations using process_pair_reps.py to average the pair representations across all models, and then split into three sets of embeddings.
4) Run Arpeggio on the relaxed GPCR-peptide pdb (top ranked by peptide pLDDT) using [arpeggio.ipynb](https://githubtocolab.com/Zebreu/DeorphaNN/blob/main/arpeggio.ipynb)
